the first step to becoming strong, is to kill all the fears in your heart.
Humans are only given an average of 70 years. all return to nothingness. There's nothing to be afraid of.
If you have a good idea just go for it.
The second step to being strong,is to develop the habit of deep thinking.
Don't just work hard. What really matters in achieving great things is wisdom.
it's the brain that counts, not just hard work.
The third step to becoming strong is not to obsess or be too serious.
In this world, many people cannot be simply divided into good or bad and many thins do not have a single standard
answer.
If you obsess and get too serious, it will not only cause serious internal friction Has no positive effect on the
matter itself.
