## arthur schopenhauer

1. wealth has little effect on promoting emotional pleasure, while health can paly a major role.
2. the luckiest people in the world are undoubtedly those with rich and outstanding personalities, especially those with profound thoughts.


## anonymity

1. you are just here to experience life 
<br/>you can't own anything 
<br/>you can't keep anything 
<br/>you don't need to prove anything 
<br/>and there is nothing that must be achieved 
<br/>what you can do is
<br/>to keep trying, harvesting, feeling 
<br/>and letting go
2. don't walk barefoot on this grass. My garden is littered with stars
3. dare and the world always yields.
4. the first step to becoming strong, is to kill all the fears in your heart.
<br/> Humans are only given an average of 70 years. all return to nothingness. There's nothing to be afraid of.
<br/> If you have a good idea just go for it.
<br/> The second step to being strong,is to develop the habit of deep thinking.
<br/> Don't just work hard. What really matters in achieving great things is wisdom.
<br/> it's the brain that counts, not just hard work.
<br/> The third step to becoming strong is not to obsess or be too serious.
<br/> In this world, many people cannot be simply divided into good or bad and many thins do not have a single standard answer.
<br/> If you obsess and get too serious, it will not only cause serious internal friction Has no positive effect on the matter itself.


## Heimerdinger

1. It's a sad truth that those who shine brightest often burn fastest.

## charles dickens

1. i wish you to know that you have been the last dream of my soul

人皆有梦，但多寡不同。夜间做梦的人，日间醒来发现心灵尘灰深处所梦不过是虚华一场；但日间做梦的人则是危险人物，因为他们睁着眼行其所梦，甚至使之可能，而我就是如此。

——托马斯 · 爱德华 · 劳伦斯在电影《阿拉伯的劳伦斯》中如是说


Fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.
  —— Neil Gaiman, Coraline




## 20220716 
今天开始记录一些生活，今天在家呆了一天，什么都没干，等到下午去取了维修好的电脑，花了1500.感觉给多了，但自己确实不善于砍价，给了1600.杭州的物价也是贵，午餐晚餐给的又少还巨贵，以前还觉得天津的也贵，没想到现在怀念起来天津的物价了。

很多花销都是很碎但又不得不去开支，结果积攒下来数额惊人，实在难受。爸妈刚给了15000，租房花了10000，电脑花了1500，单位宿舍的押金又暂时少了1600，现在仅剩1500左右了，还有很多东西是用花呗和白条买的，坚持半个月希望可以等到发工资的那天。

关于就业入职也很令人焦虑。薪资的事情一直无法尘埃落定，听说劳动合同中也不会明确给多少。但愿经过谈判可以让自己舒服一些。关于这半个月来体验到的工作感受，说实话，倒也没有想象中的大，而且由于不熟悉的原因，要是等到再和周边的人有深入交流和认识之后，可能更好。但问题是已经感觉到了工作的枯燥。非常之枯燥。那种在团队中没有任何话语权，负责人说什么就是什么的痛苦。省院的待遇也不是想象中的好。等等看吧。积攒一年后转码的动力。

想学CS了。再稍微涉猎一点EE。
