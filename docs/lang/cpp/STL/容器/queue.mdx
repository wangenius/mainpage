# queue

queues are a type of container adaptor, specifically designed to operate in a FIFO context (first-in first-out), where elements are inserted into one end of the container and extracted from the other.

queues are implemented as containers adaptors, which are classes that use an encapsulated object of a specific container class as its underlying container, providing a specific set of member functions to access its elements. Elements are pushed into the "back" of the specific container and popped from its "front".

The underlying container may be one of the standard container class template or some other specifically designed container class. This underlying container shall support at least the following operations:

1. empty
2. size
3. front,
4. back
5. push_back
6. pop_front

| member function | definition                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| (constructor)   | Construct queue                 |
| empty           | Test whether container is empty |
| size            | Return size                     |
| front           | Access next element             |
| back            | Access last element             |
| push            | Insert element                  |
| emplace         | Construct and insert element    |
| pop             | Remove next element             |
| swap            | Swap contents                   |
