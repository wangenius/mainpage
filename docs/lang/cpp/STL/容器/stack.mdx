# stack

Stacks are a type of container adaptor, specifically designed to operate in a LIFO context (last-in first-out), where elements are inserted and extracted only from one end of the container.

stacks are implemented as container adaptors, which are classes that use an encapsulated object of a specific container class as its underlying container, providing a specific set of member functions to access its elements. Elements are pushed/popped from the "back" of the specific container, which is known as the top of the stack.

The underlying container may be any of the standard container class templates or some other specifically designed container class. The container shall support the following operations:

1. empty
2. size
3. back
4. push_back
5. pop_back

| member function | definition                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| (constructor)   | Construct stack                 |
| empty           | Test whether container is empty |
| size            | Return size                     |
| top             | Access next element             |
| push            | Insert element                  |
| emplace         | Construct and insert element    |
| pop             | Remove top element              |
| swap            | Swap contents                   |
