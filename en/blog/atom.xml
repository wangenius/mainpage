<p>——[Speech by Charlie (Charles) Chaplin (1889-1977) from The Great Dictator movie (1940)]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm sorry but i don't want to be an Emperor - that's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible, Jew, gentile, black man and white. We all want to help one another, human beings are like that.</p>
<p>We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful.</p>
<p>But we have lost the way.</p>
<p>Greed has poisoned men's souls - has barricaded the world with hate; has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.</p>
<p>We have developed speed but we have shut ourselves in: machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little: More than machinery we need humanity; More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.</p>
<p>The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer togather. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness.</p>
<p>In men, cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me i say Do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress the hate of men will pass and dictators die, and the power they took from the people, will return to the people and so long as men die, liberty will never perish...</p>
<p>Soldiers - don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you, enslave you - who regiment your lives, tell you what to do ,what to think and what to feel, whor drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder! Dont't give your selves to these unnatural men, machine men, with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! you are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts. You don't hat - only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unatural. Soldiers - don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty! In the seventeenth chapter of Saint luke it is wrtten the kingdom of God is within man - not one man, nor a group of men - but in all men - in you! You the people have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness! You the people have the power to make this life free and beautiful , to make this life a wonderful adventure! Then in the name of democracy let us use that power - let us all unite!!! Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give you the future and old age and security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power, but they lie! The don not fulfil their promise, they never will! Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfil that promise! Let us fight to free the world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.</p>
<p>Soldiers - in the name of democracy, let us all unite!!!</p>]]></content>

<p>听说你现在一个人睡，后来没少遭婚姻的罪。我听到这里如此难过，又拼了命的想要保护</p>
<p>她们说提起我你沉默，常借着酒意分著对错。我不懂得你情深似海，你不懂得我思念成灾</p>
<p>不如见一面，哪怕是一眼。这世间太多的难免亏欠，你是我穿过思念的箭</p>
<p>不如见一面，哪怕就一眼，回首相濡以沫的那几年，不顾一切的你我从前</p>
<p>有时我在想这个世上，是不是有另外几个我。也这样痴痴地贪恋着，贪恋着另外几个你</p>
<p>若世上真的还会存在，存在几个你和我，我多希望他们的结局，他们的结局都能圆满</p>
<p>不如见一面，哪怕是一眼。这世间太多的难免亏欠，你是我穿过思念的箭</p>
<p>不如见一面，哪怕就一眼。回首相濡以沫的那几年，不顾一切的你我从前</p>
<p>不如见一面，哪怕是一眼。这世间太多的难免亏欠，你是我穿过思念的箭</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>the first step to becoming strong, is to kill all the fears in your heart.
Humans are only given an average of 70 years. all return to nothingness. There's nothing to be afraid of.
If you have a good idea just go for it.
The second step to being strong,is to develop the habit of deep thinking.
Don't just work hard. What really matters in achieving great things is wisdom.
it's the brain that counts, not just hard work.
The third step to becoming strong is not to obsess or be too serious.
In this world, many people cannot be simply divided into good or bad and many thins do not have a single standard
answer.
If you obsess and get too serious, it will not only cause serious internal friction Has no positive effect on the
matter itself.</p>]]></content>
